README

-letters are used for me to keep track of what nodes got sent out before each request
-changed is a timestamp although the numbers are artificially low for this sample
-ids and line_ids are the same because this is intended to be run on an empty lines table
-each dom string has the accompanying post variable at the top in a comment
